# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Dataproject**

In this data project, we will explore the development of wages for women and men from 2009 to 2021 in Denmark. Wages are an important indicator of economic well-being, and examining the trends in wages for different demographic groups can provide insight into issues of income inequality and gender disparities in the labor market. Using data from Statistics Denmark we will look at the pay gab between women and men. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. Kvinder.xlsx (Statistics Denmark) 
1. MÃ¦nd.xlsx (Statistics Denmark)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

%pip install pandas-datareader
%pip install matplotlib-venn
